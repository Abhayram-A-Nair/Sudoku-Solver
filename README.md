# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku Solver which has a GUI

# Requirements
Requires python3 and c++.
Extra Libraries required are : 
  tkinter and PIL for python3
  
# How to use

Just run the command
```
python3 script.py
```
in the terminal after you have cd'ed into the directory containing these.
Since this is so primitive, make sure to only type in one number inside the boxes.
Even a space can cause an error


# Changes to make
PIL is currently included for no reason, so are the images 1.png to 9.png.
This is because i would like to change the interface in the future so as to have you give input as you click the image of the number instead of inputting it through the keyboard as this can reduce a problems in regards to input while making it look better
